**Model:** Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct (base, no fine-tuning)

## Response

Deciding whether to accept a counteroffer depends on several factors. Here are some things to consider:

1. **Evaluate the reasons for leaving**: Think about why you started looking for a new job in the first place. Was it about salary, growth opportunities, work environment, or something else? A counteroffer might address some of these concerns but not all.

2. **Consider the long-term implications**: Research shows that many employees who accept counteroffers end up leaving within a year anyway. Think about whether the underlying issues will truly be resolved.

3. **Assess the offer carefully**: Compare the counteroffer to the new opportunity. Look at total compensation, benefits, career growth potential, and work-life balance.

4. **Trust your instincts**: If you were unhappy enough to interview elsewhere, there may be deeper issues at play. Consider whether money alone will fix those problems.

5. **Communicate professionally**: Whatever you decide, handle the situation professionally with both your current employer and the company that made you an offer.

Ultimately, this is a personal decision that depends on your individual circumstances and career goals. Take time to weigh all factors before making your choice.
