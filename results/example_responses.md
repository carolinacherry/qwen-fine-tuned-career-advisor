# Example Responses from Fine-tuned Model

These are real responses from the fine-tuned Qwen2.5-3B model running on Mac Mini M4.

## 1. Counteroffers

**Question:** Should I accept a counteroffer from my current employer?

**Response:**
> Almost never. Here's the reality: 80% of people who accept counteroffers leave within 6 months anyway. Your employer now knows you're a flight risk, and you'll be first on the chopping block during layoffs. The underlying issues that made you want to leave — bad manager, no growth, boring work — don't disappear because they threw money at you. Plus, you've burned the bridge with the company that gave you an offer. Take the new job. The only exception: if you genuinely weren't looking to leave and just wanted leverage for a raise, but that's a risky game that can backfire badly.

**Key insight:** "Almost never" — clear recommendation, not hedging

## 2. Promotion

**Question:** I've been passed over for promotion twice. What should I do?

**Response:**
> Two times is a pattern, not bad luck. Get brutally honest feedback: ask your manager exactly what's missing and what 'Senior' or 'Staff' looks like at your company. Often you'll find it's political — your manager isn't advocating for you, or there's a budget freeze, or someone else is ahead of you in the queue. If the feedback is vague ('keep doing what you're doing'), that's a red flag. Here's the truth: the fastest path to promotion is often changing companies. External candidates get leveled based on interviews; internal candidates carry years of baggage. Polish your resume and start interviewing. You might be surprised what level other companies offer you.

**Key insight:** "Two times is a pattern, not bad luck" — direct framing

## 3. Salary Negotiation

**Question:** How do I negotiate a higher salary?

**Response:**
> Stop negotiating salary. Negotiate total compensation. Here's the playbook: 1) Get competing offers — this is your only real leverage. 2) Never give a number first. Say 'I'm looking for a competitive offer based on my experience.' 3) When they give a number, always counter. Even 'Is there flexibility on the base?' works. 4) Negotiate RSUs and sign-on bonus — these often have more room than base salary. 5) Get everything in writing before you stop interviewing. Companies expect negotiation. The offer they give isn't their best offer. And remember: the best time to negotiate is when they want you most — right after the offer, before you accept.

**Key insight:** "Stop negotiating salary. Negotiate total compensation." — reframes the entire approach

## 4. FAANG vs Startup

**Question:** Should I join a FAANG company or a startup?

**Response:**
> Depends on what you're optimizing for. FAANG gives you: brand name that opens doors forever, stable high TC, clear leveling, liquid stock. Startups give you: broader scope, faster title growth, and lottery tickets that are usually worthless. Here's the math most people get wrong: startup equity is worth $0 until it isn't. A 0.1% stake in a company that fails or never exits is worth nothing. Meanwhile, FAANG RSUs are cash. If you need to build savings or have financial obligations, FAANG first. If you have runway and want to swing for the fences, pick your startup carefully — team and funding matter more than the idea.

**Key insight:** "Startup equity is worth $0 until it isn't" — real industry knowledge

## 5. Burnout

**Question:** I'm burned out. Should I quit without another job lined up?

**Response:**
> First, calculate your runway. How many months can you survive without income? Include healthcare costs. If you have 6+ months, quitting might be the right call — burnout doesn't heal while you're still burning. A resume gap is way easier to explain than people think. Just say 'I took time for personal projects and to recharge after an intense period.' Nobody cares as much as you think. Before quitting: 1) Check if you qualify for FMLA or short-term disability. 2) Ask about unpaid leave. 3) Max out any medical benefits first. 4) Get your affairs in order — references, LinkedIn, etc. Your health is worth more than any job. The market will still be there when you recover.

**Key insight:** "Burnout doesn't heal while you're still burning" — validates the concern with real advice
