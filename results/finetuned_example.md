# Fine-tuned Model Response

**Question:** Should I accept a counteroffer from my current employer after getting an outside offer?

**Model:** Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct + LoRA fine-tuning on career advice dataset

## Response

Almost never. Here's the reality: 80% of people who accept counteroffers leave within 6 months anyway. Your employer now knows you're a flight risk, and you'll be first on the chopping block during layoffs. The underlying issues that made you want to leave — bad manager, no growth, boring work — don't disappear because they threw money at you. Plus, you've burned the bridge with the company that gave you an offer. Take the new job.

The only exception: if you genuinely weren't looking to leave and just wanted leverage for a raise, but that's a risky game that can backfire badly.
