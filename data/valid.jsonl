No one person has everything. 3) Include people at various levels: peers, senior folks, people in adjacent fields. 4) Ask specifically. 'Can I reach out occasionally for career advice?' 5) Maintain relationships even when you don't need something. 6) Be useful in return. Make it mutual where possible. 7) Update them on your progress. People like to know their advice helped. Your board doesn't need to know they're on your board. They're just people whose input you value and seek out regularly."}]}

Career factors: Is this a meaningful step up? Would this opportunity exist in your current city? Life factors: Do you have roots (partner, family, community)? Are you at a life stage where mobility is easy? Financial reality: COL differences can make a 'raise' actually be a pay cut (SF vs. Austin, NYC vs. Chicago). The move itself costs money and energy. Questions: 1) Would you move for reasons other than this job? 2) What happens if the job doesn't work out? 3) Can you negotiate relocation support? Don't move just for a job. Move for a life you want, where a job happens to be part of it."}]}

Peer conversations and market data (Levels.fyi, Blind) help. If confirmed: 1) Document your contributions and market rate data. 2) Ask for an adjustment directly: 'Based on my performance and market data, I believe my comp should be X.' 3) If denied, ask what it would take and when you can revisit. 4) Don't make empty threats, but start interviewing. An offer is your best leverage. 5) If they still won't budge, the message is clear. Companies that undervalue you will continue to. The market is the market. If they won't pay market, someone else will."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I transition from banking to the buy side?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "PE/HF is the classic post-banking exit. For PE: headhunters recruit early (6-12 months into your analyst program). Excel at deal execution, rank top bucket, and nail LBO technicals. For HFs: depends on strategy. L/S equity likes banking analysts from industry groups. Network directly with funds — HF recruiting is less structured than PE. Show passion for markets and have investment ideas ready. Asset management: similar path, but CFA helps. Timing: 1.5-2 years of banking experience is the sweet spot. Prepare while banking — you won't have time once recruiting starts."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What's the best way to get experience in private equity without a banking background?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Non-traditional paths exist but are harder: 1) PE-focused consulting (Bain, EY-Parthenon) can lead to ops roles at PE firms. 2) Corporate development at companies backed by PE gives deal exposure. 3) Industry roles that lead to portfolio company positions. 4) MBA at top school, then recruit for post-MBA associate roles (still competitive). 5) Search funds/fundless sponsors for earlier-stage deal experience. 6) Joining a startup that gets acquired gives M&A exposure. The reality: PE is built to pull from banking. Without that background, you'll likely enter through portfolio ops or post-MBA recruiting. Direct deal team roles from non-banking are rare."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I know if consulting is right for me?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Consulting works for certain personalities: 1) You like variety — new problems every few months. 2) You're comfortable with ambiguity — often there's no clear answer. 3) You can work in teams constantly — no lone wolf roles. 4) You can handle heavy travel (or at least did pre-COVID). 5) You enjoy client service — even difficult clients. 6) You're okay with limited ownership — you advise, but clients implement. Red flags: you need deep expertise in one area, you hate travel, you want to build things yourself. Consulting is a great launching pad but a specific lifestyle. Try it for 2 years and see if it fits."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Should I specialize in a specific sector in investment banking?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sector specialization vs. product specialization is a key choice. Sector (healthcare, TMT, industrials): deeper industry knowledge, relationships with repeat clients, but cyclical deal flow. Product (M&A, leveraged finance, restructuring): broader exposure, more technical depth, but less client relationship building. For exits: PE firms often prefer sector specialists who know the industry. HFs care more about specific knowledge areas. Early career: generalist M&A gives broadest exposure. If you have a sector passion, lean in — enthusiasm shows in interviews. If unsure, pick a growing sector with active deal flow."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the pros and cons of working at a hedge fund?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Pros: highest comp potential in finance (top performers make millions), intellectual challenge of markets, meritocratic (your P&L is your performance review), smaller teams mean more impact, flexible culture compared to banking. Cons: high stress (losing money is visceral), job security tied to performance (bad years = potential layoff), limited exit options (HF skills don't transfer broadly), long hours during market hours, strategies can stop working. HFs are for people who genuinely love markets and can handle volatility — in their portfolio and their career. If that's not you, PE or AM might be better fits."}]}

Look for: 1) Desk rotation — exposure to multiple products (equities, FICC, derivatives). 2) Real trader interaction — you should sit on the desk, not in a back room. 3) Conversion rate — what percentage of interns get return offers? 4) Product focus — if you know you want rates vs equities, seek that exposure. 5) Culture — S&T is intense; find a floor where you'd want to work. Ask interns from prior years: Were you doing real work or just shadowing? Did you get to pitch ideas? S&T hiring is about proving you can handle the pace and think quickly."}]}

Useful angles: 1) Startup CFO/finance role gives deal exposure that translates. 2) Founding or early employee experience is valued by VCs. 3) Fintech startups bridge both worlds. 4) Corporate development at a startup that does M&A. Less useful: being a software engineer at a startup doesn't translate to banking. The standard finance path (target school → IB → exit) is well-worn for a reason. Startups can be a detour, but you'll likely need an MBA reset to pivot cleanly into traditional finance. Exception: quant trading — they hire technical talent regardless of background."}]}

Common paths: 1) Operator-turned-investor: found a successful startup or be early at one. 2) Investment banking/PE background: some firms value deal experience. 3) Consulting: gives analytical skills, though less valued than operating. 4) Angel investing on the side while doing something else. 5) MBA at top school, then VC associate roles (junior, often temporary). The reality: senior VC roles go to operators with track records or people who proved they can pick winners. Junior roles exist but often don't convert to partner. Best path: build something yourself, then invest."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What's the typical career path in asset management?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Depends on the role. Investment track: Analyst (entry) → Senior Analyst → PM (portfolio manager). Timeline varies — some become PMs in 5-7 years, others never do. Distribution/Sales: Analyst → Associate → VP → Director → MD. Client facing, relationship building. Operations/Middle Office: Support roles that can lead to leadership. Quant: Researcher → Senior Researcher → Head of Research. The pyramid: most analysts don't become PMs. To advance: generate ideas that make money, build relationships with PMs, and develop a specialty. Unlike banking where 2 years is standard, AM careers are longer — people stay if they love investing."}]}

For career changers or non-target backgrounds: MBA is the reset button. Top programs (HBS, Stanford, Wharton, Booth, Kellogg) place well into MBB. For experienced hires: rare and usually sector-specific experts. MBA provides: recruiting access, case prep support, network, credibility reset. But it's expensive (2 years + $200K+). If you're already at a target school with good GPA, go direct. If you need to break in from non-traditional background, MBA is often the path."}]}

Know the vesting schedule — 4-year with 1-year cliff is standard. Private company equity: much more complex. Key questions: 1) What's your percentage ownership (fully diluted)? 2) What's the 409A valuation? 3) What's the preference stack? 4) When is the likely exit? 5) What happens if you leave — exercise window and costs? Negotiation tactics: ask for more shares, better strike price (ISOs over NSOs), extended exercise window. For startups: never take a meaningful base pay cut for equity alone."}]}

Options: 1) Network relentlessly — 50+ coffee chats, alumni connections, LinkedIn outreach. 2) Get any finance experience — boutique banks, middle market firms, Big 4 advisory, corporate finance. 3) Maintain high GPA and relevant extracurriculars (investment clubs, stock pitch competitions). 4) Consider an MBA at a target school as a reset. 5) Start in adjacent roles (corporate banking, credit analysis) and lateral. 6) Target firms with non-target recruiting (some boutiques, regional banks). The path: get your foot in anywhere, prove yourself, then lateral up. Many successful bankers started at no-name firms."}]}
