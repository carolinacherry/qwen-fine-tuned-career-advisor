No one person has everything. 3) Include people at various levels: peers, senior folks, people in adjacent fields. 4) Ask specifically. 'Can I reach out occasionally for career advice?' 5) Maintain relationships even when you don't need something. 6) Be useful in return. Make it mutual where possible. 7) Update them on your progress. People like to know their advice helped. Your board doesn't need to know they're on your board. They're just people whose input you value and seek out regularly. Build these relationships over years."}]}

Extra pay, comp time, or nothing? 5) How mature is the system? New systems page more than stable ones. 6) Can you live your life while on-call? Some rotations are background noise; others are prison. 7) Is the team working to reduce on-call burden? On-call is part of running production systems. It's not inherently bad.

'How do you see my contributions comparing to expectations?' 4) Focus on impact, not effort. Nobody cares how hard you worked. 5) Be consistent. Regular updates feel less braggy than sudden self-promotion. 6) Let others amplify you. Share wins in contexts where teammates can vouch. 7) Own your accomplishments without apology. You did the work. There's a difference between confident communication of achievements and arrogance. The former is necessary; the latter is counterproductive."}]}

Dilute any potential negative with multiple positives. 4) For known difficult past managers, have other people from that job who can speak positively. 5) If directly asked about a difficult departure, be neutral: 'We had different approaches to X.' 6) Consider background check services that can reveal what's being said about you. You can't control what others say, but you can provide alternatives. A single bad reference among several good ones is less damaging than being the only data point."}]}

Financial obligations, family needs, and life stage matter. Later career: you've probably learned a lot; capturing value makes sense. Questions to ask: 1) How much better is the learning? Marginally or significantly? 2) Is the comp difference meaningful to your life? 3) Can you learn on your own regardless of job? 4) What do you regret not doing? Learning you skip now costs more later. Comp you skip now costs less. Usually bias toward learning unless the comp difference is life-changing."}]}

Sometimes they saw something you don't. 4) You can try to appeal, but it rarely works. Companies trust their interviewers. 5) Use it as learning. Even wrong feedback tells you how you might be perceived. 6) Move on. You can't force a company to want you. 7) Remember: interviews are noisy. A rejection isn't a verdict on your abilities. If you truly disagree with the reason, it might be a culture mismatch anyway. A company that would reject you for that reason might not be where you'd thrive."}]}

Family, hobbies, interests. 6) LinkedIn isn't enough. Actual conversation maintains relationships. 7) When paths might cross professionally, reach out first. Former colleagues become your referrals, references, and co-founders. Those relationships are worth maintaining even when you're happily employed.

Getting actual data helps. 4) Find peers at your new level. You'll see they're figuring it out too. 5) Document your accomplishments at the new level. Evidence accumulates. 6) Accept that you'll make mistakes. Everyone does when leveling up. 7) Focus on growth, not perfection. The best people at any level are still learning.

Contact them: 'I have an offer with a deadline. Any chance we can expedite?' 4) Don't lie, but don't show all your cards. 5) Companies expect some back and forth. 6) If they refuse any extension, that's information about their culture. 7) Don't accept just to buy time \u2014 exploding offers and reneging burn bridges.

What do they care about? 5) Have backup slides for details if asked. 6) Use simple visuals. No walls of text. 7) Be prepared to be interrupted. Roll with it. 8) Confidence matters.

Panic attacks peak and subside. 5) Don't judge yourself. It doesn't mean you can't do the job. 6) After: drink water, take your time returning. 7) If it's frequent, seek professional help.

Medication or therapy can help you cope. 5) Look at your finances ruthlessly. Do you actually have less runway than you think? 6) Start job searching. Even slow progress creates hope. 7) Consider whether a leave of absence is possible. 8) Cut expenses to increase your runway. You're playing survival mode while planning your exit.

'I'd like to help, but I'm already at capacity with X, Y, Z.' 5) If it's truly outside your scope and ongoing, discuss with your manager. 6) Document if it becomes a pattern.

It's normal and expected. 5) Do work that matters to their priorities. 6) Send occasional updates on high-impact projects. Not spam, just visibility. 7) Be memorable for good reasons. Quality work, helpful attitude, clear communication. Your manager should be amplifying you upward. If they're not, do it yourself tactfully.

Usually it's specific things, not everything. 4) Document their feedback. When they change their mind, you have a record. 5) Don't take it personally. It's their issue, not your work. 6) Set boundaries on endless revisions. 'We're at deadline. Can we ship this and iterate?' 7) If nothing is ever good enough, evaluate whether this is sustainable.

Don't get surprised by a big exercise bill when you leave. 7) Consider early exercise if available and the company is promising. 8) Consult a tax professional. This is not generic advice territory.

Learn from mistakes, don't beat yourself up over circumstances. 4) Look for the opportunity. Layoff might lead to better job. Failed project might teach valuable lessons. 5) Protect your narrative. How will you talk about this in interviews? 6) Don't let it define you. It's a chapter, not the whole book. 7) Use it as fuel if that works for you.

The reality: a16z has hundreds of employees now across various functions, but the investing partner roles go to people with serious operator or founder credentials. Associates exist but it's not a clear partner track. Their model values people who've built things over people who've analyzed things.

What's still true: MBB provides unmatched breadth (see 10+ industries in 2 years), the network is elite, exits to PE/corporate are strong, and the structured skill development is excellent. Worth it if: you're uncertain about your path, targeting PE ops roles, want to build a broad business toolkit, or need a credential reset. Not worth it if: you already have a clear tech path, value work-life balance highly, or would rather build than advise. The 2-3 year stint followed by a strategic exit remains an excellent career accelerator for most people."}]}

The VP to MD funnel is extremely narrow — maybe 10-20% make it. Politics intensify at senior levels. Comp at each level: Analyst all-in ~$200K+. Associate ~$300-400K. VP ~$400-600K.

If they've raised a lot at high valuations, your common stock may be underwater even at a decent exit. 4) Can you sell in secondary markets? Some companies allow liquidity before IPO. 5) What's your exercise window if you leave? The pitch: Pre-IPO equity is less risky than early-stage but still carries risk. IPOs can be delayed, down rounds happen, and market conditions change. Companies that seemed sure IPO candidates in 2021 still haven't gone public. Don't treat pre-IPO equity as guaranteed money.

PE firms recognize EY-P but may not recruit there as actively as MBB. Better than EY core consulting but not MBB-equivalent for exits. My advice: If you can get Bain, take Bain. If EY-P is your best option, it's still a valid path — you'll just need to network more aggressively and may target MM PE more than megafunds.

KKR values people who can think like owners, not just bankers. The process: Headhunters source candidates. You'll do multiple rounds including modeling tests and case studies. KKR's process is selective — they take maybe 20-30 associates per year across offices. Alternative paths: Post-MBA associate (more competitive, requires top MBA + pre-MBA deal experience), or lateral from another PE fund.

Better for IB and PE on the East Coast. Booth: Chicago location, strongest academic rigor (Nobel Prize faculty), bid-on-classes flexibility, data-driven culture, excellent for consulting and tech, strong finance curriculum but less NYC-specific network. For PE/HF: Columbia's NYC location and finance network is an advantage for East Coast finance. For consulting: Both are equally strong — MBB recruits heavily from both. For tech: Booth might edge out due to curriculum flexibility and Chicago's growing tech scene. The X-factor: Visit both. Columbia is NYC energy and finance-focused.

The reality: PE deal teams are structured to hire from IB because those analysts have the exact skills needed (modeling, deal execution, banker relationships).

For PE specifically, Wharton/HBS/Stanford place best into megafunds. What you give up: 2 years + $400-500K total cost (tuition + opportunity cost of tech salary).
